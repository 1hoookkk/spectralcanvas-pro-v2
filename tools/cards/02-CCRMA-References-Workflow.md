# 02 â€” CCRMA References Workflow

Goal
- Capture authoritative CCRMA book links and create reference cards.

Resources
- Index: https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/EE201/Related_Online_Books_CCRMA.html
- Script: `tools/process_ccrma_links.py`

Usage
- Run: `python tools/process_ccrma_links.py`
- Output: `docs/rt-audio-foundations/chunks/ccrma-references/*.md` and a `manifest.json`.

Best Practices
- Use CCRMA as the mathematical ground truth when designing algorithms.
- Cross-link relevant cards under `sessions/knowledge/pdf/cards`.
