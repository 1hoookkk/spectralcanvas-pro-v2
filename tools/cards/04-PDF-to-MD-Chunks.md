# 04 — PDF ➜ Markdown Chunks

Purpose
- Slice large PDFs into smaller Markdown chunks for targeted study.

Script
- `python tools/pdf_to_md_chunks.py --in sessions/knowledge/pdf/<file>.pdf --out sessions/knowledge/md/<prefix>`

Guidelines
- Keep chunks topic-focused; add a short summary at the top.
- Cross-reference CCRMA and project cards where relevant.
- Prefer manual review for equations and figures.
