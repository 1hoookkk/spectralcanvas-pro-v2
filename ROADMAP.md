# SpectralCanvas Pro Roadmap

## Our Vision: Paint Sound, Sculpt Music

SpectralCanvas Pro is a next-generation spectral audio editor that blends the intuitive, visual workflow of a paint program with a powerful and unique sonic engine. Our goal is to create a tool that feels less like a traditional plugin and more like a creative partner, enabling you to discover sounds that were previously impossible to imagine.

Our core inspiration comes from pioneering visual music software like MetaSynth, where the boundary between sight and sound disappears. We are building an instrument for artists, sound designers, and producers who want to interact with audio in a completely new way.

## The Path Forward

Our development is focused on four distinct phases, building from a powerful sonic core to a fully-featured, production-ready instrument.

### Phase 1: The Canvas Engine (Digital Foundation)
*Goal: Implement a pristine, high-fidelity synthesis and processing core capable of extraordinary sonic transformation.*

-   **[ ] High-Fidelity Sample Engine:** A multi-voice playback engine for loading and manipulating your own sounds.
-   **[ ] Dynamic Timbre System:** A novel spectral filter that can morph between dozens of unique sonic characteristics in real-time. This is the heart of the engine, allowing sounds to evolve from clean and precise to complex and vocal with a single gesture.
-   **[ ] Deep Modulation Matrix:** A comprehensive routing system for creating complex, evolving sounds by connecting a vast array of control sources to sonic destinations.
-   **[ ] Generative Pattern Engine:** An advanced step-sequencer and pattern generator capable of creating intricate melodic and rhythmic ideas that sync perfectly to your project.

### Phase 2: The Character Core (Analog Heart)
*Goal: Integrate the pristine digital engine with a rich, non-linear analog-inspired character section.*

-   **[ ] Analog Character Integration:** Seamlessly route the output of the Canvas Engine through a custom-modeled tube saturation and compression circuit.
-   **[ ] Unified Tone Control:** A single, intuitive "Tone" knob that blends from pure, precise digital to warm, harmonically rich saturation, giving you a huge palette of sonic color.
-   **[ ] "Always-On" Philosophy:** The character section is an integral part of the sound, ensuring the instrument always has a unique and inspiring sonic footprint.

### Phase 3: The Creative Interface (Gesture Control)
*Goal: Connect the power of the engine to the canvas, making sonic exploration fast, intuitive, and fun.*

-   **[ ] Timbre Morphing Control:** Map the vertical axis of the paint canvas to the Dynamic Timbre System, allowing you to morph between filter types with the stroke of a brush.
-   **[ ] Pressure & Velocity Mapping:** Use brush pressure to control the intensity of the analog character and stroke velocity to drive modulation depth or trigger patterns.
-   **[ ] Generative Painting:** Design a system where the shapes and rhythms of your paint strokes can be translated directly into new patterns for the Generative Pattern Engine.
-   **[ ] Real-Time Visual Feedback:** Create clear, beautiful visualizations of the filter state, modulation routings, and active patterns, so you always see what you hear.

### Phase 4: Production Polish
*Goal: Refine the instrument into a stable, CPU-efficient, and indispensable tool for professional production.*

-   **[ ] Modern Preset System:** A complete preset manager designed to save and recall the full state of the canvas, engine, and character section.
-   **[ ] High-Quality Effects:** Integrate a dual-processor effects section with studio-grade reverbs, delays, and modulation effects.
-   **[ ] Performance Optimization:** Ensure high voice counts and low-latency performance across all major DAWs.

*This roadmap is a living document and may evolve. Our commitment is to building a truly unique and inspiring instrument for modern music creation.*
