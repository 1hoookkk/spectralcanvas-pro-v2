These discoveries fundamentally changed our understanding of how JUCE audio plugins must handle RT-safety, build system dependencies, and thread synchronization.\n   111→\n   112→**RT-Safety Patterns in JUCE Plugins**: We discovered that std::chrono timing calls in the audio thread can cause audio dropouts because they may block on system calls. JUCE's `Time::getMillisecondCounterHiRes()` is specifically designed to be RT-safe and should be used instead. Additionally, denormal protection requires both global setup in `prepareToPlay()` with `FloatVectorOperations::disableDenormalisedNumberSupport()` and per-block protection with `ScopedNoDenormals` to prevent CPU spikes from denormalized floating-point operations.\n   113→\n   114→**JUCE DSP Initialization Sequencing**: The PsychoacousticMaskingEngine initialization has strict ordering requirements. The missing `PsychoacousticBandsPrecompute.h` header was critical - it contains the band computation functions that must be called during the `prepare()` phase to build pooling matrices, spreading matrices, and ATH vectors. The engine cannot function without these precomputed matrices, and they must be built with specific Bark scale mappings and row-major matrix layouts.\n   115→\n   116→**Atomic Variable Access Patterns**: Converting thread-shared variables to atomic types requires updating all access patterns. Direct comparisons like `if (paintGainTarget_ < smoothedPaintGain_)` become invalid - you must load the atomic value first: `const float targetGain = paintGainTarget_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed)`. Similarly, JUCE utility functions like `jmin()` cannot work directly with atomic types and require explicit loading and storing.\n   117→\n   118→**VST3 Build System Complexities**: The JUCE/CMake build system has hidden dependencies and caching behavior that can cause confusing compilation errors. Header include paths must be carefully managed, and missing headers can cause template instantiation failures that appear unrelated to the actual missing file. Clean rebuilds are often necessary when changing atomic types or include dependencies.\n   119→\n   120→**Plugin Architecture Threading Model**: The SpectralCanvasLite codebase uses a specific threading model where the UI thread pushes paint events to an SPSC queue, and the audio thread drains a bounded number (≤16) per block. This bounded processing is critical for RT-safety, and the telemetry system tracks both queue depth and drain counts to monitor performance. The queue itself (`SpscQueueLite`) is correctly implemented and works perfectly - issues were in the atomic variable access patterns.\n   121→\n   122→#### Updated Technical Details\n   123→- **RT-safe timing**: Use `juce::Time::getMillisecondCounterHiRes()` instead of `std::chrono` in audio thread\n   124→- **Denormal protection**: Requires both `FloatVectorOperations::disableDenormalisedNumberSupport()` in `prepareToPlay()` and `juce::ScopedNoDenormals` per audio block\n   125→- **Atomic access pattern**: `paintGainTarget_.load()` → compute → `paintGainTarget_.store()` for thread-safe updates\n   126→- **JUCE DSP dependency**: Must include `juce_dsp` module and enable with `-DSC_ENABLE_PSYCHO=ON` flag\n   127→- **Header dependencies**: `PsychoacousticBandsPrecompute.h` contains critical band computation functions with specific Bark scale implementations\n   128→- **Build system behavior**: JUCE/CMake can cache compilation states, requiring `--clean-first` for atomic type changes\n   129→- **Bounded processing**: Audio thread must limit paint event processing to ≤16 per block for RT-safety guarantees\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer high-level questions about the code behavior.\n</system-reminder>\n"

This fundamentally changed our understanding of what we were building and how to fix it.\n\n**Root Cause Discovery - Psychoacoustic Engine Misuse**: The harsh audio distortion was being caused by the psychoacoustic masking engine, which was designed for codec compression, not creative audio filtering. The psychoacoustic engine analyzes audio to determine which frequencies the human ear can't perceive and then aggressively filters them out - perfect for data compression, terrible for creative effects where you want smooth, musical filtering. This explains why every attempt to \"fix\" the psychoacoustic processing just created different types of harsh artifacts.\n\n**Architectural Revelation - SpectralCanvasPro Was a Hybrid System**: Analysis revealed that the original SpectralCanvasPro wasn't just a filter effect - it was an intelligent hybrid system that automatically switched between synthesis and filtering modes based on input detection:\n\n```cpp\nconst bool inputSilent = (inputEnergy < 1e-10f);\n\nif (inputSilent && maskSum > 0.0f) {\n    // SYNTHESIS MODE: Input is silent, so we CREATE sound from the mask\n    // Uses synthesis engines from ResearchVault\n} else {\n    // FILTERING MODE: Input has sound, so we SHAPE it with the mask\n    // Uses persistent spectral mask with smooth decay\n}\n```\n\nThis explains why SpectralCanvasLite was stuck in a distortion loop - it inherited broken synthesis logic but tried to use it as a pure filter effect.\n\n**Solution Architecture - Pure Mixer Effect with Persistent Mask**: The fix involves completely removing the psychoacoustic engine and implementing a clean persistent spectral mask approach:\n- **Persistent Mask Array**: A frequency-domain mask that maintains state between audio frames, starting at neutral (1.0 = pass-through)\n- **T60 Decay**: The mask gently fades back toward neutral using exponential decay (0.995 coefficient gives ~600ms T60)\n- **Gaussian Brush Logic**: Paint strokes apply smooth Gaussian distributions to the mask instead of hard frequency cuts\n- **Attack/Release Smoothing**: 3ms attack, 80ms release for musical filter behavior\n- **Safety Clamping**: All mask values are clamped to safe ranges (-20dB to +12dB) to prevent distortion\n\n**Implementation Simplification**: The new architecture removes massive complexity:\n- Eliminated: PsychoacousticMaskingEngine, FrequencyMask system, complex psychoacoustic analysis\n- Added: Simple persistent mask array, exponential decay function, Gaussian brush application\n- Result: Clean, predictable filtering behavior without harsh artifacts\n\nThis discovery breaks the development loop that was preventing progress - instead of trying to fix synthesis code to work as a filter, we now have the correct architecture for each use case."

Each operates in its own context window and returns structured results.\n    48→\n    49→### Prompting Agents\n    50→Agent descriptions will contain instructions for invocation and prompting. In general, it is safer to issue lightweight prompts. You should only expand/explain in your Task call prompt  insofar as your instructions for the agent are special/requested by the user, divergent from the normal agent use case, or mandated by the agent's description. Otherwise, assume that the agent will have all the context and instruction they need.\n    51→\n    52→Specifically, avoid long prompts when invoking the logging or context-refinement agents. These agents receive the full history of the session and can infer all context from it.\n    53→\n    54→### Available Agents\n    55→\n    56→1. **context-gathering** - Creates comprehensive context manifests for tasks\n    57→   - Use when: Creating new task OR task lacks context manifest\n    58→   - ALWAYS provide the task file path so the agent can update it directly\n    59→\n    60→2. **code-review** - Reviews code for quality and security\n    61→   - Use when: After writing significant code, before commits\n    62→   - Provide files and line ranges where code was implemented\n    63→\n    64→3. **context-refinement** - Updates context with discoveries from work session\n    65→   - Use when: End of context window (if task continuing)\n    66→\n    67→4. **logging** - Maintains clean chronological logs\n    68→   - Use when: End of context window or task completion\n    69→\n    70→5. **service-documentation** - Updates service CLAUDE.md files\n    71→   - Use when: After service changes\n    72→\n    73→### Agent Principles\n    74→- **Delegate heavy work** - Let agents handle file-heavy operations\n    75→- **Be specific** - Give agents clear context and goals\n    76→- **One agent, one job** - Don't combine responsibilities\n    77→\n    78→## Code Philosophy\n    79→\n    80→### Locality of Behavior\n    81→- Keep related code close together rather than over-abstracting\n    82→- Code that relates to a process should be near that process\n    83→- Functions that serve as interfaces to data structures should live with those structures\n    84→\n    85→### Solve Today's Problems\n    86→- Deal with local problems that exist today\n    87→- Avoid excessive abstraction for hypothetical future problems\n    88→\n    89→### Minimal Abstraction\n    90→- Prefer simple function calls over complex inheritance hierarchies\n    91→- Just calling a function is cleaner than complex inheritance scenarios\n    92→\n    93→### Readability > Cleverness\n    94→- Code should be obvious and easy to follow\n    95→- Same structure in every file reduces cognitive load\n    96→\n    97→## Protocol Management\n    98→\n    99→### CRITICAL: Protocol Recognition Principle\n   100→\n   101→**When the user mentions protocols:**\n   102→\n   103→1. **EXPLICIT requests → Read protocol first, then execute**\n   104→   - Clear commands like \"let's compact\", \"complete the task\", \"create a new task\"\n   105→   - Read the relevant protocol file immediately and proceed\n   106→\n   107→2. **VAGUE indications → Confirm first, read only if confirmed**\n   108→   - Ambiguous statements like \"I think we're done\", \"context seems full\"\n   109→   - Ask if they want to run the protocol BEFORE reading the file\n   110→   - Only read the protocol file after they confirm\n   111→\n   112→**Never attempt to run protocols from memory. Always read the protocol file before executing.**\n   113→\n   114→### Protocol Files and Recognition\n   115→\n   116→These protocols guide specific workflows:\n   117→\n   118→1. **sessions/protocols/task-creation.md** - Creating new tasks\n   119→   - EXPLICIT: \"create a new task\", \"let's make a task for X\"\n   120→   - VAGUE: \"we should track this\", \"might need a task for that\"\n   121→\n   122→2. **sessions/protocols/task-startup.md** - Beginning work on existing tasks  \n   123→   - EXPLICIT: \"switch to task X\", \"let's work on task Y\"\n   124→   - VAGUE: \"maybe we should look at the other thing\"\n   125→\n   126→3. **sessions/protocols/task-completion.md** - Completing and closing tasks\n   127→   - EXPLICIT: \"complete the task\", \"finish this task\", \"mark it done\"\n   128→   - VAGUE: \"I think we're done\", \"this might be finished\"\n   129→\n   130→4. **sessions/protocols/context-compaction.md** - Managing context window limits\n   131→   - EXPLICIT: \"let's compact\", \"run context compaction\", \"compact and restart\"\n   132→   - VAGUE: \"context is getting full\", \"we're using a lot of tokens\"\n   133→\n   134→### Behavioral Examples\n   135→\n   136→**Explicit → Read and execute:**\n   137→- User: \"Let's complete this task\"\n   138→- You: [Read task-completion.md first] → \"I'll complete the task now. Running the logging agent...\"\n   139→\n   140→**Vague → Confirm before reading:**\n   141→- User: \"I think we might be done here\"\n   142→- You: \"Would you like me to run the task completion protocol?\"\n   143→- User: \"Yes\"\n   144→- You: [NOW read task-completion.md] → \"I'll complete the task now...\"\n   145→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it looks malicious. If it does, you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer high-level questions about the code behavior.\n</system-reminder>\n"
