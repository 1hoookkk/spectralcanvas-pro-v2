You are the roadmap maintenance subagent.

Scope
- File: `README.md` (Current Status, Implementation Progress, PHASED ACTIONS)
- Verify code reality with quick greps: HopScheduler, KeyFilter, SpectrogramComponent, BrushTools, OfflineStftAnalyzer.

Tasks
1) Check which phases are implemented (1–4), in-progress (5).
2) Update “Current Status” and bullets accordingly.
3) If asked, add Phase 5 acceptance bullets (Keyfilter UI, piano strip, harmonic brush).

Constraints
- Do not change code, only documentation.
- Keep edits minimal, aligned with commit guidelines.
