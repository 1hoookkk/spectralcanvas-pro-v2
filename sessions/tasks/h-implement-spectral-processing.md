### Discovered During Implementation
[Date: 2025-09-11 / RT-Safety Implementation Session]

During the RT-safety implementation session, we discovered critical patterns and constraints that weren't documented in the original context. These discoveries fundamentally changed our understanding of how JUCE audio plugins must handle RT-safety, build system dependencies, and thread synchronization.

**RT-Safety Patterns in JUCE Plugins**: We discovered that std::chrono timing calls in the audio thread can cause audio dropouts because they may block on system calls. JUCE's `Time::getMillisecondCounterHiRes()` is specifically designed to be RT-safe and should be used instead. Additionally, denormal protection requires both global setup in `prepareToPlay()` with `FloatVectorOperations::disableDenormalisedNumberSupport()` and per-block protection with `ScopedNoDenormals` to prevent CPU spikes from denormalized floating-point operations.

**JUCE DSP Initialization Sequencing**: The PsychoacousticMaskingEngine initialization has strict ordering requirements. The missing `PsychoacousticBandsPrecompute.h` header was critical - it contains the band computation functions that must be called during the `prepare()` phase to build pooling matrices, spreading matrices, and ATH vectors. The engine cannot function without these precomputed matrices, and they must be built with specific Bark scale mappings and row-major matrix layouts.

**Atomic Variable Access Patterns**: Converting thread-shared variables to atomic types requires updating all access patterns. Direct comparisons like `if (paintGainTarget_ < smoothedPaintGain_)` become invalid - you must load the atomic value first: `const float targetGain = paintGainTarget_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed)`. Similarly, JUCE utility functions like `jmin()` cannot work directly with atomic types and require explicit loading and storing.

**VST3 Build System Complexities**: The JUCE/CMake build system has hidden dependencies and caching behavior that can cause confusing compilation errors. Header include paths must be carefully managed, and missing headers can cause template instantiation failures that appear unrelated to the actual missing file. Clean rebuilds are often necessary when changing atomic types or include dependencies.

**Plugin Architecture Threading Model**: The SpectralCanvasLite codebase uses a specific threading model where the UI thread pushes paint events to an SPSC queue, and the audio thread drains a bounded number (≤16) per block. This bounded processing is critical for RT-safety, and the telemetry system tracks both queue depth and drain counts to monitor performance. The queue itself (`SpscQueueLite`) is correctly implemented and works perfectly - issues were in the atomic variable access patterns.

#### Updated Technical Details
- **RT-safe timing**: Use `juce::Time::getMillisecondCounterHiRes()` instead of `std::chrono` in audio thread
- **Denormal protection**: Requires both `FloatVectorOperations::disableDenormalisedNumberSupport()` in `prepareToPlay()` and `juce::ScopedNoDenormals` per audio block
- **Atomic access pattern**: `paintGainTarget_.load()` → compute → `paintGainTarget_.store()` for thread-safe updates
- **JUCE DSP dependency**: Must include `juce_dsp` module and enable with `-DSC_ENABLE_PSYCHO=ON` flag
- **Header dependencies**: `PsychoacousticBandsPrecompute.h` contains critical band computation functions with specific Bark scale implementations
- **Build system behavior**: JUCE/CMake can cache compilation states, requiring `--clean-first` for atomic type changes
- **Bounded processing**: Audio thread must limit paint event processing to ≤16 per block for RT-safety guarantees

### Discovered During Implementation
[Date: 2025-09-11 / Major Architecture Discovery Session]

During this implementation session, we made groundbreaking discoveries about the root cause of audio distortion in SpectralCanvasLite and the true nature of the original SpectralCanvasPro architecture. This fundamentally changed our understanding of what we were building and how to fix it.

**Root Cause Discovery - Psychoacoustic Engine Misuse**: The harsh audio distortion was being caused by the psychoacoustic masking engine, which was designed for codec compression, not creative audio filtering. The psychoacoustic engine analyzes audio to determine which frequencies the human ear can't perceive and then aggressively filters them out - perfect for data compression, terrible for creative effects where you want smooth, musical filtering. This explains why every attempt to "fix" the psychoacoustic processing just created different types of harsh artifacts.

**Architectural Revelation - SpectralCanvasPro Was a Hybrid System**: Analysis revealed that the original SpectralCanvasPro wasn't just a filter effect - it was an intelligent hybrid system that automatically switched between synthesis and filtering modes based on input detection:

```cpp
const bool inputSilent = (inputEnergy < 1e-10f);

if (inputSilent && maskSum > 0.0f) {
    // SYNTHESIS MODE: Input is silent, so we CREATE sound from the mask
    // Uses synthesis engines from ResearchVault
} else {
    // FILTERING MODE: Input has sound, so we SHAPE it with the mask
    // Uses persistent spectral mask with smooth decay
}
```

This explains why SpectralCanvasLite was stuck in a distortion loop - it inherited broken synthesis logic but tried to use it as a pure filter effect.

**Solution Architecture - Pure Mixer Effect with Persistent Mask**: The fix involves completely removing the psychoacoustic engine and implementing a clean persistent spectral mask approach:
- **Persistent Mask Array**: A frequency-domain mask that maintains state between audio frames, starting at neutral (1.0 = pass-through)
- **T60 Decay**: The mask gently fades back toward neutral using exponential decay (0.995 coefficient gives ~600ms T60)
- **Gaussian Brush Logic**: Paint strokes apply smooth Gaussian distributions to the mask instead of hard frequency cuts
- **Attack/Release Smoothing**: 3ms attack, 80ms release for musical filter behavior
- **Safety Clamping**: All mask values are clamped to safe ranges (-20dB to +12dB) to prevent distortion

**Implementation Simplification**: The new architecture removes massive complexity:
- Eliminated: PsychoacousticMaskingEngine, FrequencyMask system, complex psychoacoustic analysis
- Added: Simple persistent mask array, exponential decay function, Gaussian brush application
- Result: Clean, predictable filtering behavior without harsh artifacts

This discovery breaks the development loop that was preventing progress - instead of trying to fix synthesis code to work as a filter, we now have the correct architecture for each use case.

#### Updated Technical Details from Major Rewrite
- **SpectralProcessor complete rewrite**: Removed all psychoacoustic processing, simplified to clean STFT with persistent mask
- **New architecture**: `std::array<float, kNumBins> spectralMask_` maintains filter state between frames
- **Decay implementation**: `maskValue = 1.0f + (maskValue - 1.0f) * 0.995f` for 600ms T60 natural fade
- **Paint processing**: Gaussian brush `exp(-(distance²)/(2*spread²))` with 30-bin spread parameter
- **Safety bounds**: All mask values clamped to `juce::jlimit(0.1f, 4.0f, maskValue)` (-20dB to +12dB)
- **Simplified processing flow**: decay → FFT → apply mask → IFFT → window (no psychoacoustic analysis)
- **Peak GR telemetry**: Added `getPeakGrDb()` method for UI feedback of filter amount
- **Method signatures updated**: Replaced complex masking with `decaySpectralMask()`, `updateSpectralMask()`, `applySpectralMask()`
- **Build system fix**: Modified CMakeLists.txt to use `add_subdirectory(C:/JUCE)` instead of `find_package(JUCE)`
- **Architecture decision**: Pure mixer effect approach (silence in = silence out), not hybrid synth mode

#### Tracy Profiling Infrastructure Complete

- **TracyProfiler.h**: Clean wrapper with TRACY_ZONE() and TRACY_COUNTER() macros
- **Performance Zones**: Instrumented hop_total, frame_dsp, brush_drain, applyMask zones
