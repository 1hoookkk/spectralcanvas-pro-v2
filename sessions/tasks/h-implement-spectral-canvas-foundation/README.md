## Context Files
- docs/PsychoacousticEngine_Analysis.md - Core psychoacoustic IP analysis
- docs/SpectralSynthEngine_Analysis.md - Synthesis engine analysis
- C:\spectralCanvasPro\ResearchVault\ - Source vault with 237+ files
- C:\spectralCanvasPro\HANDOFF_TO_CLAUDE.md - Strategic handoff document
- Source/DSP/PsychoacousticMaskingEngine.h - Already ported engine

## User Notes
**Strategic approach**: Start small with infrastructure, add complexity incrementally behind feature flags. Focus on RT-safety and clean architecture over feature completeness. Each phase must be shippable.

**Ghost Code Prevention**: Enforce explicit CMake source lists, orphan detection, strict warnings, and dual-config CI (flags OFF/ON). Archive don't delete - keep ResearchVault external.

**Key Principles**:
- Explicit is better than implicit (no GLOB)
- Every file must have a purpose and owner
- Start minimal, add complexity behind flags
- Test early, test often

## Context Manifest

### How The Current Architecture Works: SpectralCanvasLite Phase 1 Foundation

SpectralCanvasLite represents a strategic rebuild of SpectralCanvasPro from a clean foundation, mining high-value components from a 4000+ file ResearchVault while preventing technical debt accumulation. The project follows a 5-phase incremental approach where each phase must pass strict validation gates before proceeding.

**The Current State (Phase 1)**: The codebase implements a basic JUCE audio plugin infrastructure with organized Source/ directory structure. When a user launches the plugin in a DAW, it creates a SpectralCanvasProProcessor (the main AudioProcessor) paired with a SpectralCanvasProEditor (the UI component). The processor currently implements simple "ducking" behavior - when users paint on the canvas, it attenuates the audio signal as a placeholder for future spectral processing.

The architecture centers around real-time (RT) safety. All audio processing in processBlock() must avoid heap allocations, locks, or any blocking operations. This is enforced through strict compiler warnings (-Werror -Wall) and planned validation with pluginval at strictness level 8+. The design uses atomic counters for telemetry and lock-free queues for UI→audio thread communication.

**Directory Organization**: The Source/ folder follows a logical hierarchy:
- `Source/Core/` - Plugin infrastructure (SpectralCanvasProProcessor, MaskColumn event structures, atomic Snapshot counters)
- `Source/DSP/` - Audio processing components (currently only PsychoacousticMaskingEngine.h/cpp)
- `Source/UI/` - Interface components (SpectralCanvasProEditor with paint canvas and telemetry display)
- `Source/Utils/` - RT-safe utilities (SpscQueueLite lock-free queue for bounded communication)

**The Paint Event Flow**: When users click and drag on the editor canvas, mouseDown/mouseDrag events create MaskColumn structures containing paint data. These are pushed into a SpscQueueLite (single-producer, single-consumer lock-free queue) with 1024 capacity. In processBlock(), the audio thread drains up to 16 events per block (bounded work constraint), converts paint intensity to gain attenuation, and applies simple smoothed gain reduction. This maintains RT-safety while providing immediate audio feedback.

**Telemetry and Monitoring**: The system tracks performance through atomic counters in the Snapshot structure: processedBlocks, queueDepth, drainsThisBlock, rejectedPushes, processingTimeMicros, etc. These use relaxed memory ordering for efficient updates and are displayed in a real-time HUD overlay. The UI updates at 30 FPS via juce::Timer callbacks, copying snapshot data safely.

**Build System and Feature Flags**: CMakeLists.txt implements explicit source file lists (no GLOB patterns) to prevent ghost code accumulation. Two critical feature flags control compilation: SC_ENABLE_STUB (defaults OFF) for future SpectralEngineStub integration, and SC_ENABLE_PSYCHO (defaults OFF) for PsychoacousticMaskingEngine. This allows incremental feature activation without breaking existing functionality.

### The Key Interface Conflict: MaskColumn Design Mismatch

**The Critical Problem**: Two incompatible MaskColumn designs exist in the codebase. The processor expects Claude's design with individual fields (intensity, columnIndex, startBin, endBin, timestamp, sequenceNumber), but MaskColumn.h implements Gemini's design with only a per-bin array approach (std::array<float, 257> values, uint64_t timestampUiMicros, uint32_t sequenceNumber).

SpectralCanvasProProcessor.cpp calls `column.isValid()` and `column.intensity` (lines 105-108), but these methods/fields don't exist in the current MaskColumn.h. Similarly, SpectralCanvasProEditor.cpp references `column.intensity`, `column.columnIndex`, `column.startBin`, `column.endBin`, and `column.timestamp` in createMaskColumnFromMouse() (lines 138-151), none of which exist in the current interface.

This creates compilation failures because the processor was written expecting Claude's individual-field approach, but the header file implements Gemini's array-based approach. The code tries to access non-existent members and call non-existent methods.

### Current Build Issues and JUCE Integration Problems

**Primary Compilation Error**: Cannot open include file 'JuceHeader.h' in MaskColumn.h line 2. This indicates incorrect JUCE header inclusion patterns. Modern JUCE (8.0.8) requires specific module includes like `<juce_audio_processors/juce_audio_processors.h>` rather than the legacy `<JuceHeader.h>` monolithic header.

**Missing Implementation**: Several .cpp files are listed in CMakeLists.txt but don't exist:
- SpectralCanvasProProcessor.cpp exists and compiles (when headers are fixed)
- SpectralCanvasProEditor.cpp exists but has interface mismatches
- Core component integration is incomplete

**Header Dependency Chain**: The current includes create a fragile dependency web:
- MaskColumn.h incorrectly includes `<JuceHeader.h>`
- SpectralCanvasProProcessor.h correctly includes `<juce_audio_processors/juce_audio_processors.h>`
- This mismatch causes compilation failure cascade

### For New Feature Implementation: Resolving the Foundation

To complete Phase 1 successfully, we need to resolve the interface conflicts and build issues systematically:

**MaskColumn Interface Resolution**: Choose one consistent MaskColumn design. The processor expects individual fields (intensity, isValid() method, etc.), so either:
1. Modify MaskColumn.h to include the missing fields/methods, or  
2. Refactor all processor code to use the array-based approach

**Header Inclusion Fix**: Replace `<JuceHeader.h>` with proper modular JUCE includes:
- `<juce_audio_processors/juce_audio_processors.h>` for AudioProcessor functionality
- `<juce_gui_basics/juce_gui_basics.h>` for UI components
- Remove legacy header dependencies

**Build System Completion**: Ensure all files listed in CMakeLists.txt exist and compile:
- Verify source file paths match actual file locations
- Test both feature flag states (SC_ENABLE_PSYCHO ON/OFF)
- Validate strict warning compliance

**RT-Safety Integration**: Wire the corrected MaskColumn structures through the complete pipeline:
- UI thread: createMaskColumnFromMouse() → paintEventQueue_.tryPush()
- Audio thread: paintEventQueue_.tryPop() → processPaintEvents() with bounded drains
- Telemetry: Update atomic counters for monitoring

The PsychoacousticMaskingEngine is already ported and functional but disabled by default (SC_ENABLE_PSYCHO=OFF). It will integrate in Phase 2 when STFT processing is added, but Phase 1 focuses on the RT-safe infrastructure foundation.

### Technical Reference Details

#### Current MaskColumn Interface Issues

**Expected Interface** (used by processor):
```cpp
struct MaskColumn {
    float intensity;
    int32_t columnIndex; 
    int32_t startBin, endBin;
    double timestamp;
    uint32_t sequenceNumber;
    bool isValid() const;
};
```

**Actual Interface** (in MaskColumn.h):
```cpp
struct MaskColumn {
    static constexpr int kNumBins = 257;
    std::array<float, kNumBins> values;
    uint64_t timestampUiMicros = 0;
    uint32_t sequenceNumber = 0;
    // Missing: intensity, columnIndex, startBin, endBin, timestamp, isValid()
};
```

#### JUCE Module Requirements

Replace legacy includes with:
```cpp
#include <juce_audio_processors/juce_audio_processors.h>  // AudioProcessor, etc
#include <juce_gui_basics/juce_gui_basics.h>             // Component, Graphics
#include <juce_audio_utils/juce_audio_utils.h>           // AudioProcessorEditor
```

#### Critical Build Paths

- **Implementation files**: All exist but have interface mismatches
- **CMake configuration**: C:\SpectralCanvasLite\CMakeLists.txt with explicit source lists
- **Feature flag control**: SC_ENABLE_PSYCHO, SC_ENABLE_STUB (both default OFF)
- **Validation target**: pluginval strictness ≥8, zero warnings with -Werror

#### RT-Safety Architecture

The audio thread follows strict bounded operation constraints:
- Maximum 16 paint event drains per processBlock() call
- All communication via lock-free atomic operations (std::memory_order_relaxed)
- Telemetry updates without blocking or heap allocation
- Hard clamp audio output to ±1.0f for safety

This foundation prepares for Phase 2 STFT integration and Phase 3 spectral processing, but must be stable and RT-safe first.
