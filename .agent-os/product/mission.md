## Pitch

SpectralCanvas Pro is a visual audio synthesis plugin that transforms sound design into an artistic act by providing a living, interactive spectrogram canvas where musicians paint directly onto the frequency spectrum.

## Users

- Electronic music producers seeking intuitive sound design
- Sound designers who think visually  
- Live performers needing expressive real-time control

## The Problem

1. Traditional spectral editors are clinical and disconnected from creative flow
2. Most synthesis plugins hide the actual frequency content behind knobs and sliders
3. The gap between seeing sound and shaping it

## Differentiators

- The spectrogram IS the interface - not a visualization panel
- "Liquid light" paint strokes that feel alive and responsive
- Visual properties map to sonic properties (color=pitch, brightness=volume, sharpness=timbre)

## Key Features

- Living Waveform Canvas with real-time spectral display
- Paint-to-audio pipeline with multiple brush types
- Quantize Brush for harmonic correction
- Visual-to-sonic mapping system
- Real-time spectral synthesis engine
- Gesture recording and playback
- VST3 and Standalone formats
- Emergency test tone for debugging
