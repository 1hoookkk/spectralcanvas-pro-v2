# Session Notes: 2025-08-27 - Project Initialization

## Session Goals
- [x] Establish complete technical architecture for SpectralCanvas Pro v2
- [x] Create comprehensive development standards and RT-safety rules
- [x] Set up project documentation structure
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 implementation (JUCE setup + basic rendering)

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Thread Model**: Audio↔UI↔GPU with lock-free SPSC queues exclusively
- **Graphics API**: Direct3D 11 primary (Windows), OpenGL 3.3 fallback
- **Audio Framework**: JUCE 8.0.8 for maximum stability and feature support
- **Target Performance**: <5ms audio latency, 60fps visuals, <15% CPU usage

### Technology Stack Finalized
- **Language**: C++20 with RAII and modern STL usage
- **Build System**: CMake with MSVC 2022 primary compiler
- **Graphics**: HLSL compute shaders for spectral processing
- **RT-Safety**: Zero audio thread allocations, custom allocator tracking

### Development Priorities
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3)**: Foundation - JUCE integration + D3D11 + fake spectral sweep
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6)**: Living Nebula visuals with particle instancing
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-9)**: EMU Z-plane filter morphing + tube saturation
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 10-12)**: Professional features + cross-DAW validation

## Implementation Strategy
- **Documentation First**: Complete technical specs before coding begins
- **RT-Safety First**: Audio thread constraints are non-negotiable
- **REAPER Validation**: Primary DAW target for early stability testing
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality first, advanced features later

## Risk Mitigation Established
- Conservative GPU feature detection with fallback paths
- Comprehensive RT-safety validation tooling
- Early and frequent DAW integration testing
- Performance monitoring with automated regression detection

## Next Session Priorities
1. Update CMakeLists.txt to JUCE 8.0.8
2. Create Source/ directory structure matching existing references
3. Implement basic PluginProcessor/Editor skeletons
4. Begin MessageBus lock-free queue implementation
5. Start D3D11 context creation and basic rendering

## Technical Debt & Notes
- Need to verify JUCE 8.0.8 compatibility with existing CMake setup
- D3D11 device lost scenarios require robust handling
- Consider GPU memory constraints for 4K display support
- Particle system design needs careful memory management strategy

## Performance Baselines to Establish
- Audio processing latency measurement framework
- GPU framerate monitoring with particle count scaling
- Memory usage profiling across all threads
- CPU utilization tracking per processing component
